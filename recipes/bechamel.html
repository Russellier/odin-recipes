      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        A creamy classic - your standard white sauce! In its purest form, bechamel is comprised of butter and flour that have been cooked together (a mixture that's also known as a roux) and milk, with just a bit of seasoning. The result is a silky cream sauce that can be used either on its own or as the base for countless other sauces.

### A basic recipe website

This is a basic website showing three recipes in three different pages. It uses ordered and unordered lists to display information regarding the recipes. I tried using nested lists but it seemed unnecessary for this project. Images are also inserted in each page except for the homepage.

Edit: I added some basic styling like colors, fonts, shadows and more.
